# 👋 Hey there, I'm Rashu (`@rashudevelopment`)

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a creative and passionate FiveM developer focused on crafting innovative, open-source scripts for QBCore and other frameworks. I believe in sharing knowledge, building community, and making high-quality resources free and accessible for everyone—including unlocking exclusive MLOs for the public.

## 👀 My Interests
- **FiveM Script Development:** Designing clean, efficient, and interactive scripts that elevate roleplay and enhance the FiveM experience for players and server owners.
- **Open Source Contributions:** I love sharing my code with the community to inspire others and help them build better servers.
- **Empowering Developers:** Creating a space where developers—especially girls in tech—can collaborate, grow, and support one another.

## 🌱 What I’m Currently Learning
- **Advanced Lua & JS:** Expanding my skills to build even more dynamic and responsive scripts.
- **MLO Unlocking:** Exploring safe and ethical techniques to unlock premium MLOs and share them with the community for free.

## 💞️ What I’m Looking to Collaborate On
- **FiveM Projects:** I'm on the lookout for serious partners or investors who want to build a unique and inclusive RP server from the ground up.
- **Community-Driven Scripts:** Got an idea for a script? I’ll make it happen—free of charge. Let’s build things that serve the community and help us all grow.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
